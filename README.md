# Matplotlib - The Power of Plots

# Background

The aim was to create visualizations for real-world pharmaceutical data, sourced from Pymaceuticals Inc. Pymaceuticals specializes in anti-cancer pharmeceuticals, specifically screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a common occuring form of skin cancer.

The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Capomulin, verses other treatments. This analysis used 2 datasets that were imported and cleaned using jupyter notebooks and Python Pandas, and visualized in Matplotlib to make statistical analysis.

# Observable Trends

The bar graph shows there are 10 treatments in the study. The highest number studied is treated by Capomulin. On the other hand, the lowest number studied is treated by Propriva.  The study was more focused towards Capomulin compared to other treatments.

The correlation between the weight of the mouse and the volume of the average tumor is 0.84. This concludes when the weight increases the volume of the tumor increases.

The regression analysis helped to understand how much the average tumor volume will change when the weight of the mice change. The R-squared value is 0.70, which means 70% of the model fits the data.  Higher R-squared values represent smaller differences between the observed data and the fitted value. 

The pie graph below shows the distribution of the mouses sex. Even though there are more male mice then female mice treated, however the statistics shows there is only a 2% difference. Therefore, sex may not be a significant variable to the study.

Capomulin and Ramicane reduces the size of tumors more.

# Summary Statistics 

A summary statistics table was generated by creating multiple series and adding them all together at the end. The summary statistics table consists of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.
