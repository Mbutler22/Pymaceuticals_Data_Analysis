# Matplotlib - The Power of Plots

#Background

The aim was to create visualizations for real-world pharmaceutical data, sourced from Pymaceuticals Inc. Pymaceuticals specializes in anti-cancer pharmeceuticals, specifically screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a common occuring form of skin cancer.

The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Capomulin, verses other treatments. This analysis used 2 datasets that were imported and cleaned using jupyter notebooks and Python Pandas, and visualized in Matplotlib to make statistical analysis.

#Observable Trends

The bar graph shows the Drug Regimen Capomulun has the maximum mice number, and Zoniferol has the minimum number of mice.

The correlation between the weight of the mouse and the volume of the average tumor is 0.84. This concludes when the weight increases the volume of the tumor increases.
